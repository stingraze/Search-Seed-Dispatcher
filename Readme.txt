This is a sample for making search engine database increase by a big number.

It's easy to use. 

First separate words into one word per line in meishi.txt.

Use tools such as chasen or mecab for splitting words (especially Japanese)

Run seed-dispatcher.pl using Perl

The seeds.txt will be made. 

Use the seeds.txt to start crawling for your search engine.

Simple as that.
